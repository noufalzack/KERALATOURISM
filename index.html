            <h1>COME AND ENJOY OUR CULTURE</h1>

            <P>
            <H2>The culture of Kerala has developed over the past millennia, influences from other parts of India
                and
                abroad.It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali
                people. Modern Kerala society took shape owing to migrations from different parts of India and
                abroad throughout Classical Antiquity.

                Kerala traces its non-prehistoric cultural genesis to its membership (around the AD 3rd century) in
                a vaguely defined historical region known as Thamizhagom a land defined by a common Tamil culture
                and encompassing the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms. At that time, the music, dance, language
                first Dravida Bhasha "Dravidian language (possibly Proto-Tamil)", and Sangam (a
                vast corpus of Tamil literature composed between 1,500 - 2,000 years ago) found in Kerala were all
                similar to that found in the rest of Thamizhagom (today's Tamil Nadu). The culture of Kerala evolved
                through the Sanskritization of Dravidian ethos, revivalism of religious movements and reform
                movements against caste discrimination.[7][8][9] Kerala showcases a culture unique to itself
                developed through accommodation, acculturation, and assimilation of various faculties of civilized
                lifestyle</H2>
